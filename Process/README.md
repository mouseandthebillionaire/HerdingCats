Thinking of this as a sandbox to experiment with a) using voice as control and b) building an interface-only game. This initial build has the visualizer screen and agents (i.e "cat") who can navigate the space. Select Q,W,E,R,T,Y to issue commands to a specific (but unknown at this point) agent. There are no goals! More soon.
